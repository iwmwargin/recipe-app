  ## Description
  This is an app that is designed using Spoonacular API to find recipes stored within it's database.  There is a functioning search bar that will return recipes related to what is searched.  There is also a Homepage that contains the top Vegetarian recipes and overall Popular recipes.  Below the search bar there are icons that will direct you to Italian, American, Thai, or Japanese Recipes.  Each recipe will have a picture of the dish, a synopsis of the dish, as well as needed ingredients and instructions to make it.  Depending on where the recipe comes from, there may even be nutritional information or related recipes.
